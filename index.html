    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Parjita, a researcher, problem solver, and explorer. Think of me as a data aficionado in training, armed with a keyboard and a hefty dose of caffeine.</p>
    <p>Inside this portfolio, you'll find a mishmash of projects where I've attempted to crack the code of data mysteries. Some might make you go "Wow," and others might make you go "Huh?" but hey, that's all part of the journey, right?</p>
    <p>So, if you're in the market for someone who can spin data into gold, then look no further! Grab a snack, sit back, and let's embark on this wild ride through the world of data together. Trust me, it's gonna be a hoot!</p>
