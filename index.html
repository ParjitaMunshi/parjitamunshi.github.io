Used DL and ML models LSTM, Random Forest, and Multinomial Na√Øve Bayes, achieved 85% accuracy rate.Techniques like TF-IDF and text-vectorization helps to clean data and presented in more accurate way which help to identify toxic words most effectively. Utilized LIME identifier to find the which words contribute most sorted in high to low by toxicity percentage to identify the comments are toxic. By this project we can easily identify that which comments are harmful. </p>
