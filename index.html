            <h3>Graduate Research Assistant @ Northeastern University</h3>
            <h4>ICU Data Management</h4>
            <p>In this project, I spearheaded the management of intraoperative data within the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) setting. My role involved meticulously handling time-series data on a per-patient basis, ensuring accuracy and completeness. Utilizing sophisticated techniques such as missing value imputation, including forward fill and interpolation, I guaranteed the integrity of the dataset. This meticulous approach laid the foundation for robust analysis, facilitating informed decision-making in critical care scenarios.</p>
            
            <h4>Cardiovascular Disease Classification</h4>
            <p>In the Cardiovascular Disease Classification Project, I led a comprehensive analysis of 2.3 million medical records to detect cardiovascular diseases among patients. Leveraging advanced analytics, I developed and implemented a healthcare classification system aimed at identifying and categorizing patients into amputated and non-amputated groups. This involved the application of sophisticated algorithms and data analysis techniques to extract actionable insights from complex medical data. By enhancing the accuracy of disease detection and patient stratification, this project significantly contributed to improving healthcare outcomes and treatment efficacy.</p>

            <a href="https://github.com/ParjitaMunshi/Moderation-Application"><img src="/images/moderation_app.png" alt="Moderation App"></a>
            <p>Development of a toxic comment classification model leveraging LSTM, Random Forest, and Multinomial NaÃ¯ve Bayes algorithms, achieving an 85% accuracy rate. This initiative significantly improved moderation efficiency and ensured effective management of online content by accurately identifying harmful comments. Additionally, I enhanced the model's performance by 15% through the implementation of TF-IDF and text-vectorization methods, refining feature representation techniques for better toxic language identification. Furthermore, I revamped the interpretability of predictions using LIME, identifying weights of high-to-low toxicity words, resulting in a 25% improvement in model interpretability. This enhanced understanding and trust in the model's decisions, fostering a safer and more transparent online environment.</p>
