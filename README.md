## Work Experience

### Graduate Research Assistant  @ Northeastern University
#### ICU Data Management:
- In this project, I spearheaded the management of intraoperative data within the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) setting. My role involved meticulously handling time-series data on a per-patient basis, ensuring 
  accuracy and completeness. Utilizing sophisticated techniques such as missing value imputation, including forward fill and interpolation, I guaranteed the integrity of the dataset. This meticulous approach laid 
  the foundation for robust analysis, facilitating informed decision-making in critical care scenarios.

#### Cardiovascular Disease Classification:
- In the Cardiovascular Disease Classification Project, I led a comprehensive analysis of 2.3 million medical records to detect cardiovascular diseases among patients. Leveraging advanced analytics, I developed 
  and implemented a healthcare classification system aimed at identifying and categorizing patients into amputated and non-amputated groups. This involved the application of sophisticated algorithms and data 
  analysis techniques to extract actionable insights from complex medical data. By enhancing the accuracy of disease detection and patient stratification, this project significantly contributed to improving 
  healthcare outcomes and treatment efficacy.

### Junior Software Engineer @ ekZero Software Service
- I led projects focused on enhancing website development, user experience, and operational efficiency. By gathering feedback from a sizable user base, I informed strategic enhancements resulting in heightened user satisfaction and engagement levels. Utilizing the Duda platform, I developed seamless websites for a large user cohort, prioritizing user experience and achieving a significant speed improvement through Vue.js optimization. Additionally, I ensured error-free functionality and efficiency through design and implementation optimizations using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, exploring advanced solutions with Angular and React. Operating within an agile framework, I managed multiple service-providing websites, emphasizing user-centric design principles to align with strategic objectives from requirements gathering to delivery.

## Projects

### [Moderation App](https://github.com/ParjitaMunshi/Moderation-Application)
![Moderation App](/images/moderation_app.png)
- Development of a toxic comment classification model leveraging LSTM, Random Forest, and Multinomial NaÃ¯ve Bayes algorithms, achieving an 85% accuracy rate. This initiative significantly improved moderation efficiency and ensured effective management of online content by accurately identifying harmful comments. Additionally, I enhanced the model's performance by 15% through the implementation of TF-IDF and text-vectorization methods, refining feature representation techniques for better toxic language identification. Furthermore, I revamped the interpretability of predictions using LIME, identifying weights of high-to-low toxicity words, resulting in a 25% improvement in model interpretability. This enhanced understanding and trust in the model's decisions, fostering a safer and more transparent online environment.

### [Amazon Review Classification]( https://github.com/ParjitaMunshi/Amazon-Reviews-Classification)
![Amazon Review Classification](/images/amazon_review.jpg)
- Performed comprehensive sentiment analysis initiative on a dataset comprising 5000 Amazon reviews, extracting valuable insights into customer sentiments. By employing a combination of advanced machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, LSTM, BERT, and OpenAI techniques, I boosted review classification accuracy and efficiency by 15%, enhancing decision-making with actionable insights. Additionally, I leveraged ChatGPT for natural language processing, achieving an impressive 87% accuracy in sentiment analysis. This optimized the interpretation of customer feedback and contributed to successful decision-making processes, ultimately improving product understanding and enhancing customer satisfaction.

### [Political Violence and News Analysis Nigeria]( https://github.com/ParjitaMunshi/Political-Violence-and-News-Analysis-Nigeria)
![Political Violence and News Analysis Nigeria](/images/airbnb.png)
- Conducted a thorough analysis of political violence and news incidents in Nigeria, employing a range of statistical techniques and visualizations to support strategic decision-making. By delving into time-related data and geographic patterns, I unearthed valuable insights into the dynamics of political violence and its correlation with news incidents. Through in-depth analysis, I identified common events, and high-risk factors, and conducted monthly trends analysis of news data. Utilizing techniques such as word cloud visualization, I effectively communicated key findings, shedding light on prevailing issues and informing proactive measures for mitigating risks and promoting stability in Nigeria.
